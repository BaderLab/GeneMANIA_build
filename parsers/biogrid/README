The biogrid parsing scripts were originally written by Sara. I've made some slight changes to them for our
purposes. The original scripts are in the sara directory in case we need them later. 

To use the script start by running: parsebiogrid.py makedir
This will create the directory structure for each organism: 

biogrid/
|-- At
|   |-- processed
|   |   |-- direct
|   |   `-- shared_neighbor
|   `-- raw
|-- Ce
|   |-- processed
|   |   |-- direct
|   |   `-- shared_neighbor
|   `-- raw
|-- Dm
|   |-- processed
|   |   |-- direct
|   |   `-- shared_neighbor
|   `-- raw
|-- Hs
|   |-- processed
|   |   |-- direct
|   |   `-- shared_neighbor
|   `-- raw
|-- Mm
|   |-- processed
|   |   |-- direct
|   |   `-- shared_neighbor
|   `-- raw
`-- Sc
    |-- processed
    |   |-- direct
    |   `-- shared_neighbor
    `-- raw

Dowload the version of biogrid to be used and copy the raw files into the raw directory under each organism
directory.

Once the raw files have been copied, you can process them by running: parsebiogrid.py process
All processed files will be stored under each organism's processed/direct directory.
