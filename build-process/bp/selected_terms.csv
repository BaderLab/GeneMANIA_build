6-Mercaptopurine,66,Human,"Cancer, Chemotherapy",5,"From Wikipedia: Mercaptopurine (also called 6-Mercaptopurine, 6-MP or its brand name Purinethol) is an immunosuppressive drug.

It is a thiopurine.[1]  It is used to treat leukemia. It is also used for pediatric non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,[citation needed] polycythemia vera,[citation needed] psoriatic arthritis,[citation needed] and inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis).[2]

It has demonstrated some in vitro effectiveness against Mycobacterium paratuberculosis.[3]"

Methotrexate,67,Human,"Cancer, Chemotherapy",5,"From Wikipedia: Methotrexate (rINN) (pronounced /mɛθəˈtrɛkseɪt/), abbreviated MTX and formerly known as amethopterin, is an antimetabolite and antifolate drug used in treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. It acts by inhibiting the metabolism of folic acid. Methotrexate replaced the more powerful and toxic antifolate aminopterin, and the two should not be confused with each other."
